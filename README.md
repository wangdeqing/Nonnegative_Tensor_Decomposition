# Nonnegative Tensor Decomposition
Nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (NCP) Tensor Decomposition Algorithms

**PROX-ANQP**: NCP using proximal algorithm and alternating nonnegative quadratic programming based on block principal pivoting method.
**PROX-iHALS**: NCP using proximal algorithm and inexact hierarchical alternating least squares.
